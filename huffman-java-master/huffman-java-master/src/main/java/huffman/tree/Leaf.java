     * from the root to a leaf, where `false` represents Left and `true` represents Right. In the Branch class this method
     * should be called recursively on the left and right children of the branch, adding `false` to the list
     * of booleans passed to the recursive call on the left child, and `true` to the list of booleans passed to
     * the recursive call on the right child. The return value should be the merged map containing the results of both
     * recursive calls. In the Leaf class the method should create a new map then store both the character (the label
     * of the leaf) and the list of booleans (the path to that leaf), and return the resulting map.
     *
     * @param list  The list representing paths through the tree, modified copies of which are passed to
     *              recursive invocations of the method.
     * @return the map of characters and paths
